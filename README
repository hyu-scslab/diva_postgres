To build DIVA, please compile the project with the flag "DIVA" like below:
$ ./configure --prefix=path_to_install CFLAGS="-DDIVA"

You can parameterize the buffer size for p-leaf pages and ebi-tree version pages like below:
$ ./configure --prefix=path_to_install CFLAGS="-DDIVA -DPLEAF_NUM_PAGE=10000 -DEBI_NUM_PAGE=10000"

PLEAF_NUM_PAGE: the number of p-leaf buffer pages (x 4KiB)
EBI_NUM_PAGE: the number of the ebi-tree buffer pages (x 8KiB)

database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system

PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
file COPYRIGHT.  A comprehensive documentation set is included in this
